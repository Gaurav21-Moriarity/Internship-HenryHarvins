There is also an option of accessing real life problems with the help of the industry experts.

"I am currently doing my content writing course at Henry Harvin. I started the content writing course at Henry Harvin only after I explored other alternatives. Every search on the internet always threw this institute at me. So I called them and got connected to Mr Sunny, the relationship manager. He did a fantastic job of explaining the course and its benefits. I even got recommendations from non-content writers to join Henry Harvin.

Fortunately, I got the most coveted trainer, ""Vandana Saxena"". Her knowledge, training skills, and delivery are impeccable. She clarifies every doubt without fail. Her vast experience and talent as a writer and a trainer not only makes the class enjoyable but is well worth every penny spent.

Henry Harvin carries a reputation and lives up to it. This curriculum is appropriate and aptly developed. The instructors focus on refining writing skills by giving assignments. One can repeat the classes multiple times and attend different batches with different trainers. They provide guaranteed internships to sharpen one's writing skills.

I recommend Henry Harvin content writing course to everyone who wants to be a better writer. For more please check Henry Harvin Content Writing Course Reviews.",5
"Dear All, while many have written good things about this institute, i did not have a good experience with it. I joined HenryHarvin for FICO course in Feb and despite paying full course fee upfront, I still dont have server access to practice. SAP is not a typical academic learning but an practical/experiential traning and without server practice anything you learn is waste because bookish learning does not work here. Henry's sales team is hyperactive boasting that its the best in the market, but it is light years from reality. At least I would never suggest this institute again to anyone with this experience.",1
"I was browsing about information related to improving writing skills, I came to know about Content Writing and its increasing scope these days. I choose Henry Harvin for pursuing Content Writing course as I found the course to be planned and structured. The 32 hours of extensive content writing course training gives the learners exposure to all essential aspects related to content like language skills, graphic skills, SEO, SEM, blogging, and many more things.

Once I made my decision I registered for the course. My relationship manager, Chandrika answered every possible query and apprehension I had regarding the course.

The course structure designed by Henry Harvin is simple and easily understood by a person like me who has no previous experience in the field of Content Writing. Our trainer Mrs. Vandana Saxena is not only a good faculty but also an experienced Content Writer who shared her valuable learnings with all the trainees. The recorded videos and all the study material were also helpful as they always helped me to refer back and have clarity about the doubts.


Henry Harvin also nurtures you as a Content Writer through its internship program. It also helps in Job placement. For more please check Henry Harvin content writing course reviews.

"Hi,
my batch was 13th sep 2020. Henry Harvin is well known institute so i was bit worried about completion of my course.
What i was looking for is under one roof. my relationship manager Chandrika explained me very-well. then to i was worried about my trainer and batch mates?
But on first day of my course i got surprised of having a fabulous trainer Vandana ma'am. till last day of the  course,i didn't get exactly what she is? A trainer, A friend, A batch mate, A adviser, A famous witer...she plays with us very-well through out the course. A good teacher knew every child is special.firstly she took out our knowledge and then she show where we were right and where wrong?
I am a vernacular medium student then to i find everyone friendly.
I strongly recommend Henry harvin institute to my friends. For their service, Relationship manager, Trainer, LMS, convenient timings and most importantly value our time. How much they cover in a month it almost take a year or more time in college to get certified.
Thank You.

"I did six sigma course From Henry Harvin.
Excellent faculty, very responsive, project support, complete DMAIC phase in easy way. I would recommend it. Go for it...",5
"Any positive reviews you read are fake about Henry Harvin. This is a big scam. I have no idea if they really teach anything or not. Their website looks real but I doubt it is a real educational institution. Do not get involved with this. They are in India not San Francisco, and even though they have San Francisco phone number and address is it most likely fake.",1

So if you are looking for a course in content writing, Henry Harvin would be a great option.

I had a dream of becoming a content writer and I think I have chosen the right path for making it come true.",5
"I found it very useful. Now I am very much confident that post doing a few more practice and research, I can land myself in the job of my dreams :)

Even I am willing to start my own blog because now I am pretty much skilled to increase the traffic on my website.

The another good aspect of this course is the- that they provide digital library, LMS. The course content here is well structured and we can even get all the recorded session at one place.

If anybody, looking forward to increase their interpersonal and professional skills, then I would like to recommend this course to them !

Moreover, the cherry on the cake is the HH consultants, these people are so cooperative, and they are so concerned about their brand and they do all the promises they make to their students. Grom sending jobs to internship opportunities they always stand apart.

Thank you guys",5
I attended Rohit’s six sigma green belt program in Delhi. I really loved the way he made us imagine every step and learn.,5
I attended the content writing course in Delhi. And had a great experience with their trainer Tulika,5
It's a crap course. Don't fall for their fake and false high promises. The whole course is time and money wastage. I wasted my precious time and money. They didn't give any internship or placement as they promise.,1
"If you guys are planning to take the online content writing course please don't. They will only be in touch with you while enrollment after the course they will just treat you like nobody. Specially for online students they will not provide you with you certificate even after a month and in between if you loose a job opportunity or two, it's no big deal. I feel bad for the trainer who was very good and had put out all her knowledge for the students. But the unprofessional attitude of the Henry Harwin's staff will get on your nerves gradually. And also, if you know the founder only then can you get a job placement from them otherwise they will keep sending you the same mail over and over again, the contacts in it never reply. I wasted my time and money with them.. you make sure you don't.",1
It was a nice learning experience. The six sigma course is highly appreciated and recommended for those who need a deeper knowledge on various aspects,4
"

There is some helpful information here but it is poorly written and full of errors. Both the questions and the answers had tons of mistakes. Furthermore, when I finished the course I electronically received a mock certificate that didn’t have my name on it. I used the identification number to validate the certificate through tefl.org and it was invalid.

"The course, by definition, does work, but is is marred by numerous typos, errors, and bad UX on their page.

On top of this, this lessons are skewed by pro-western statements, as if the guy is trying to push small minded propaganda through his classes. You see Biblical references, yet you get a good deal of his opinion on spanking, etc. The desperate guy should keep to teaching the lesson, period. When you have syntax typos for a lesson on grammar and punctuation, you know your time isn’t being spent properly. Typical, ignorant (and so, confident) American.

Why take lessons on international affairs from someone who will never truly experience the world because it’s always through his forced and skewed Western perspective? Just ugly.

Definitely not recommended.",2
"I paid 25000 for the course but the teaching pedagogy was so bad that I didn't even attend the complete course and asked for a refund. Of course, they never paid me back.

They changed the instructor on the last minute and the environment is not conducive to learning. They said you don't need a computer to learn analytics. Just watch the instructor doing it on screen and you will learn it!!

You end up sitting with other students and instructors who are incompetent and feel like you got cheated Don't go for it. Rather go for some nano degree online.
